                   Yes! If you are dissatisfied with your product or it arrives damaged you

                <p class = "answer">
                     Because we package each order ourselves and ship usig USPS the order will take average
                    of 2-3 weeks to get to you. This may be longer (or shorter) depending on your location.

                <p class = "answer">
                    We try to add new products every month, but depending on how busy the shop is it may be more or less often.

                    Do offer anything other than fruit themed products?
                </p>
                <p class = "answer">
                    Fruit is our niche! Fruit products are what we are passionate about and so you will only find fruit themed products in our shop.
                    We try to offer a wide range of styles and fruits, but if you don't want a some piece of fruit this probably isnt the shop for you. But if you
                    know someone who does love fruit like show them our page!
