    	      <p>We hired Emma for our wedding and she was able 
    	      to capture the most beautiful moments between us and our family. 
    	      She was so patient and willing to work with us and our family on our 
    	      hectic wedding day. We cherish our wedding photos and look at them all the time.

    	      <p>Emma did senior photos for my daughter and we were wanting 
    	      a timeless look. The black and white photography was perfect 
    	      and Emma delivered beautiful and classic photos.

    	      <p>My friend and I wanted to bring a photographer along on a hike to 
    	      take some candid photos of us and Emma was amazing! Not only did she 
    	      go along with our crazy idea, she captured the most amazing pictures 
    	      of my friend and I. It was a great way to remember one of our favorite 
    	      hobbies and Emma made it fun.

    	      <p>We spent forever trying to find a photographer for our engagement 
    	      photos and when we came across Emma we knew that her black and white 
    	      style was the one for us. The way that Emma shoots is laid back and we 
    	      could tell she wanted to take pictures that represent us as a couple.

    	      <p>Working with Emma was seamless and she made the process of booking 
    	      so easy.  I was really looking forward to my session because Emma made 
    	      sure that all of the details were taken care of.
